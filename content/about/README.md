# About

I am a self-taught developer whose origin story harkens back to the days when I was a naive kid building terrible websites like “Fortune Cookie Universe” on Angelfire with numerous GIFs and marquee elements and hacking themes on Xanga and LiveJournal. After a few detours and becoming an I/O Psychologist, I would finally connect the dots and bring his passion for technology and user experience together. I am currently a Fullstack Engineer on the Meltano team at GitLab.

Aside from coding, I am a huge advocate giving back to the community through teaching, mentoring, speaking and organizing events. I am a co-founder of VueDC and VueMeetups which helps to organize Vue.js prospectives and enthusiasts. And in my free time, you can find me searching for new culinary experiences, traveling the world, or exploring some new hobby I recently learned about.
