# Quer entrar em contato?

I am currently only accepting requests for training, workshops, and speaking gigs. If you are a recruiter, I love you, but please don’t call or email me.

If you would like to get in touch, please shoot me an email at [bencodezen@gmail.com](mailto:bencodezen@gmail.com) and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can! 

Or if you prefer to get in touch with me via social media channels, here they are:
